# Interference-Optics

The code in this repository applies concepts of optical physics, and currently operates without user-input.
(Interference with Thin Films will be added soon)

## Overview

This program covers Interference Optics and calculates the minimal thicknesses of a liquid layer (given seven color wavelengths) needed to achieve constructive and destructive interference in a combination of three solutions. All mechanics are based on the Linked List data structure, but to keep things simple, I have placed a limit of three liquids at a time.
